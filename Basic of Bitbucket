3. Create a New Repository:
    To start a new Git repository, navigate to your project's root directory and run:

4. Stage and Commit Changes:
    Add files to the staging area:

    bash:
    git add filename

  Commit changes to the repository:

    bash:
    git commit -m "Your commit message"

5. Check Status and Differences:
    Check the status of your repository:

    bash:
    git status

    View the changes made to your files:
    bash:
    git diff

6. Create Branches:
    Create a new branch:

    bash:

    Switch to a branch:

    bash:
    git checkout branch_name

   Combine changes from one branch to another:

   bash:
   git merge branch_name

7. Remote Repositories:
   Clone a repository from a remote source:

   bash:
   git clone repository_url

   Add a remote repository:

   bash:
   git remote add origin repository_url

   Push changes to a remote repository:

   bash:
   git push origin branch_name

8. Pull Changes:
   To get changes from a remote repository to your local repository:

   bash:
   git pull origin branch_name

9. GitHub:
    Create a GitHub account: https://github.com/
    Create a new repository on GitHub.
    Connect your local repository to the remote GitHub repository:

    bash:
    git remote add origin repository_url
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main

This is a basic introduction to Git. 
As you become more familiar with Git, you can explore advanced features such as branching strategies, rebasing, and resolving conflicts.
Additionally, platforms like GitHub provide a graphical interface to make collaboration and project management more straightforward.
